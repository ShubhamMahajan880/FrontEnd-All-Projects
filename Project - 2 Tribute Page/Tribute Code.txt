        <p>Aryabhata was known as the first major mathematician from the classical time of Indian Mathematics. He was also qualified as a physicist after he gave relativity of motion. His contribution to mathematics, astronomy, and science is enormous. He was the one to calculate the circumference of the earth.
            Aryabhata’s contribution in the field of mathematics, physics and astronomy is very helpful for the current scientific world; everyone will be grateful forever to him for his inventions, concepts, theorems. His work helped in many ways in the progress of today’s science.
            Aryabhatiya ends with spherical astronomy in Gola, where he applied plane trigonometry to spherical geometry by projecting points and lines on the surface of a sphere onto appropriate planes. Topics include prediction of solar and lunar eclipses and an explicit statement that the apparent westward motion of the stars is due to the spherical Earth’s rotation about its axis. Aryabhata also correctly ascribed the luminosity of the Moon and planets to reflected sunlight.
            Aryabhata weighed 794 pounds (360 kg) and was instrumented to explore conditions in Earth’s ionosphere, measure neutrons and gamma rays from the Sun, and perform investigations in X-ray astronomy. The scientific instruments had to be switched off during the fifth day in orbit because of a failure in the satellite’s electrical power system. Useful information, nevertheless, was collected during the five days of operation.
